I have made a website which give you a quick dive into the world of colors. Colors may seem simple, but they are so complicated that people spend hours trying to
work out which color would be best for whatever they are doing. Designers see colors differently than normal people, and there is so much to it that it can fill 
several encyclopedias. I hope this project makes it easier for you to understand colors.
